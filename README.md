This project includes Docker support for easy deployment. The application runs on port 3000 by default unless the port is mapped to a domain.

**Build and run with Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This command will:
- Build the Docker image
- Start the container in detached mode
- Make the application available on port 3000

**Stop and remove the service:**

```bash
docker compose down
```

This will stop the running containers and remove them along with the associated networks.
